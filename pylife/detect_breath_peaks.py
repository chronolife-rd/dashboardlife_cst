    """**Extract extrema in a respiration (RSP) signal**

    Low-level function used by :func:`.rsp_peaks` to identify inhalation and exhalation onsets
    (troughs and peaks respectively) in a preprocessed respiration signal using different sets of
    parameters. See :func:`.rsp_peaks` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_cleaned : Union[list, np.array, pd.Series]
        The cleaned respiration channel as returned by :func:`.rsp_clean`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of :func:`.rsp_cleaned` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    method : str
        The processing pipeline to apply. Can be one of ``"khodadad2018"`` (default), ``"scipy"`` or
        ``"biosppy"``.
    amplitude_min : float
        Only applies if method is ``"khodadad2018"``. Extrema that have a vertical distance smaller
        than(outlier_threshold * average vertical distance) to any direct neighbour are removed as
        false positive outliers. I.e., outlier_threshold should be a float with positive sign (the
        default is 0.3). Larger values of outlier_threshold correspond to more conservative
        thresholds (i.e., more extrema removed as outliers).
    peak_distance: float
        Only applies if method is ``"scipy"``. Minimal distance between peaks. Default is 0.8
        seconds.
    peak_prominence: float
        Only applies if method is ``"scipy"``. Minimal prominence between peaks. Default is 0.5.

    Returns
    -------
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information, in this case the samples at which inhalation
        onsets and exhalation onsets occur, accessible with the keys ``"RSP_Troughs"`` and
        ``"RSP_Peaks"``, respectively.
